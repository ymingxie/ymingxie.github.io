My contribution:
1. I implemented all the related code.
2. I conducted all the related experiments.
3. I proposed to use view-independent volume instead of depth-maps and reduce the redundant computation.
4. I proposed to use GRU to fuse previous information in view-independent volume to make the current reconstructed surface to be globally consistent with the previous reconstructed surface.
5. I made all the figures of the paper.
6. I made the demo.
7. I took part in the writing in experiments.
